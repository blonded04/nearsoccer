# nearsoccer

We don't store any of our code on github, instead we're using Amazon's AWS CodeCommit.
To download our project you should `git clone` it from this address:
```
https://git-codecommit.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/Nearsoccer
```

Because AWS CodeCommit doesn't support public repositories you should use this credentials to clone/pull:
```
